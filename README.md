# Main_Python_Project

A small Python utilities project containing a chatbot and music library helper scripts. This repository is a personal collection of simple tools and learning experiments.

## What this project does

- `main.py` — likely the project entry point (simple runner / demo). Run this to exercise the project's features.
- `chatbot.py` / `AI_mode.py` — simple chatbot / AI interaction scripts. They contain logic for handling user input and generating responses.
- `Music_lib.py` — utilities related to managing or playing a local music library (e.g., listing tracks, searching by metadata).

The project provides a set of small command-line utilities and examples to demonstrate Python scripting, file I/O, and simple chatbot interactions.

## Features

- Basic chatbot interface (text-based).
- Simple music library utilities (scan, list, search).
- Modular scripts that can be extended or imported as modules in other projects.

## Tech & Dependencies

- Python 3.8+ (recommended)
- See `requirement.txt` for third-party packages used by the project. If that file is missing or empty, the project may only rely on the standard library.

To install dependencies (if any):

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## How to run

1. Create (optional) and activate a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install required packages (if present):

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

3. Run the main script (or run specific modules):

```
python main.py
# or run individual scripts
python chatbot.py
python Music_lib.py
```

## File overview

- `main.py` — project entry point / demo runner.
- `chatbot.py` — chatbot example (text input/output loop).
- `AI_mode.py` — alternate chatbot/AI mode helper.
- `Music_lib.py` — functions for working with a local music library.
- `requirement.txt` — list of Python dependencies.
- `README.md` — this file.

If you'd like, I can:

- Inspect each script and add more precise usage instructions and examples.
- Add a simple CLI wrapper so each module can be invoked with `-m` and documented help.

## Development notes / assumptions

- I assumed the project is small and primarily uses the standard library. If you have external dependencies, please update `requirement.txt` and I'll add install/run details.
- If you want a more polished README (badges, license, contribution guide), tell me which sections to include.
