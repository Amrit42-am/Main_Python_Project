# Main_Python_Project

A small collection of Python utility scripts and learning experiments. This repository contains simple tools for a text-based chatbot and basic music-library utilities.

## Quick overview

- `main.py` — project entry point / demo runner
- `chatbot.py` — text-based chatbot example (input/output loop)
- `AI_mode.py` — alternate chatbot/AI helper logic
- `Music_lib.py` — simple music library utilities (scan, list, search metadata)
- `requirement.txt` — project dependencies (if any)

This repository is intended for personal learning and lightweight utilities. The code is organized as simple, importable modules that can be extended.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer (3.10+ recommended)
- See `requirement.txt` for any third-party packages. If you don't have that file or it is empty, the scripts likely use only the standard library.

Install dependencies (if present):

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Quick start

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install requirements (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

3. Run the main demo or individual scripts:

```bash
python main.py

## Requirements

```

2. Install requirements (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

3. Run the main demo or individual scripts:

```bash
python main.py
# or run a specific script
python chatbot.py
python Music_lib.py
```

## Examples

- Start the chatbot: `python chatbot.py` — then type messages at the prompt.
- Use `Music_lib.py` to scan or list music files (see comments in the file for usage hints).

## File summary

- `main.py` — demo runner / example usage
- `chatbot.py` — chatbot loop and helper functions
- `AI_mode.py` — alternative chatbot/AI modes
- `Music_lib.py` — utilities for browsing/searching a local music collection
- `requirement.txt` — dependencies list

## Next steps / suggestions

1. Add a small CLI (argparse / click) so each module has `--help` and clear commands.
2. Add a `requirements.txt` (if external packages are used) and confirm package names/versions.
3. Add minimal tests for core functions (e.g., chatbot response helpers, music metadata parsing).
4. Improve README with examples extracted from each script (I can do this if you want).
